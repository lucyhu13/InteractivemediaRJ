left,Awake," Sofia Aronov,Italian Creative Director and multimedia artist","This work ""Awake"" was created in 2018 by Sofia Aronov. This is an Interactive Projection Mapping artwork with electric paint and it is a personal project. This is a very simple program, but very interesting. It is an exploration of the future development of illustration. Aronov makes the images move, reacting to their surroundings and the viewer. She created this work by combining the materiality of paint and the immateriality of light with the power of capacitive sensing. She wanted to encourage the audience to have more interaction with the painting, breaking the traditional relationship between people and paintings, and the audience is no longer through contemplation. Come and admire the painted objects. The back of Canvas is connected to Arduino Uno. By collecting data and then transmitting it to processing, each sensor has different animation.",pictures/awake.png,,Sofia Aronov 2018,,https://projection-mapping.org/awake-electric-ink-painting-projection-mapping/,"Electric Ink Painting , Projection Mapping ", 
left,Colourfied Lux,"Artist,Melbourne, Computer Art Design ","Jon McCormack is a Melbourne artist who enjoys exploring the possibilities of computers and using them as an aid to increase creativity. Much of his work is about electronic nature, a kind of artificial life that can replace living things if they lose their essence in future developments. One example is his work Colourfied Lux, an interactive sculptor an artificial generative ecosystem of color from 2017. The work interacts with his perceived environment, forming Stigmergic relationships based on perceived colors. This miniature disc world reflects the relationship between organisms and their environment, regarding the self-regulation of organisms, self-supporting systems, and changes in the environment will ultimately affect their form. Used to represent a variety of characteristics of real ecosystems: symbiosis, interdependence, mimicry, and predator-prey relationships.",pictures/1.jpg,,Colourfield Lux  2017,,https://jonmccormack.info/,https://aiartists.org/jon-mccormack,

Born in Tokyo in 1980, he moved to London in 2005 to study product design at the Royal College of Art, where he developed his interests in music and design. Central to Suzuki's practice is collaboration. He has collaborated with many musicians, Google, and is a partner of Pentagram. His works have been collected by many international museums and have a certain influence internationally. Many of his works explore the realm of sound and examine the relationship between people and their environment. This little robot can scan the black lines drawn on the white paper and move accordingly. It will make a specific sound when it comes into contact with the colored marks. They have a white shape and look like some kind of musical symbols. Suzuki believes that through this installation, the audience can be invited to contribute to the public installation, and it can also enrich the collective creation of sound works. At the same time the device was her attempt to create new musical notation since she has dyslexic and cannot read musical scores, but at the same time she is passionate about music.",pictures/lookslikemusic.jpg,,Yuri Suzuki 2013,,https://aiartists.org/jon-mccormack,https://www.yurisuzuki.com/projects/looks-like-music,

This change in form greatly breaks through the limitations of traditional musical instruments. It eliminates the pain of fingering training and the boring repetitive practice of traditional musical instruments, allowing everyone to easily enjoy learning musical instruments. Users only need to follow the product's light prompts to play, and can easily complete the accompaniment playing and singing in 5 minutes.",pictures/liberlive.jpg,,2023,,https://www.liberlive-music.com/#/index/m1/,stringless technology guitar,

They believe that sound is increasingly important in the visual realm, so they want to integrate visual and auditory practices and explore different tools and designs to achieve multi-faceted, multi-sensory experiences. Most of their work is based on textiles and flexible materials. This work uses electric paint to screen-print bare conductive materials directly onto the textile surface, and then uses the MIDI protocol to communicate with the required software through the Arduino microcontroller and produce sound, which seems to be a new type of screen. It provides a hyper connected, interwoven user experience. Liquid MIDI integrates touch, kinesthetic and auditory senses, breaking the traditional visual-based interaction model.",pictures/MIDI.jpg,,esteban de la torre and judit eszter karpati  2017,,https://www.designboom.com/technology/ejtech-liquid-midi-07-20-2015/,Experimental textile，interactive，flexible materials,

Many of his works aim to make people aware of the problems they are facing today. This MB>CO2 mainly wants to express the impact of human online activity on carbon dioxide emissions. By calculating the emissions of each activity, such as zoom calls, spotify music, etc., the device will release of carbon dioxide gas in a spherical terrarium, the plants inside begin to wilt as the carbon dioxide increases and as more internet activities happen . In order not to kill the plants, he used low-power screens and computers and limited the running time to half an hour per month.",pictures/MB>co2.png,,Thijs Biersteker 2022,,https://thijsbiersteker.com/mbco2,installation，environment,

After the release of their second-generation work ""Megashield"" after their first-generation work, they called it the largest shield ever. The team is focused on improving optical technology to make people and objects invisible in broad daylight. This device takes convenience and water resistance into consideration. It can be folded to a minimum of one-third of its original size and is available in different sizes. There is no battery in it, and superpowers are turned into reality only through an ultra-large precision-designed lens array. These arrays form the surface of the shield, redirecting light reflected from those behind the shield away from the observer and out of sight, effectively masking the objects behind it. The team's design is to see how far it can push this technology and make what was once impossible possible.",pictures/invisibleshield.webp,,invisibility shield co.

This Website is one of the creations they sell, using simple colors and flow to form the style of the entire website. The homepage of this webpage is mainly based on mouse movement to obtain interaction, and this form runs throughout the entire website. On the home page, the mouse is like a magnifying glass, allowing the background color to slide while moving. I think this idea can be implemented using processing, and then using javascrpit to change the shape of the mouse. In other pages, when the mouse is placed on some pictures, a circle will appear, and then other picture shapes will be displayed. On the web page layout, most of the content is large, and the subinformation will be next to it and use small fonts.",pictures/monopo.png,, a creative website ,,https://monopo.london/," Creative coding , web design",
leftDoubleImage,Zauberflöte,"Programer, Architect artist","Michael Hansmeyer is a programmer and architect artist. He likes to use computers to explore and generate different buildings. Most of his works use 3D printing to become reality. He believes that modern architecture needs to explore different possibilities, and he is determined to explore a new situation, an architectural style that surprises, excites or provokes. He wanted to break the logic of traditional CAD programs and develop a new model, using computer algorithms to create new tools. Zauberflöte is his work in 2018. It is a set for the opera ""Die Zauberflöte"". The pure white architectural background in this work shows a magical world. Artificial caves, birdcatcher's feathers, white lead with artificial flies, or symmetrical architecture deepen the sense of drama. The Zauberflöte Grotto is a luxurious and exciting space, and when using computer algorithms, a lot of uncertainty was found, but Michael thought it was desirable and went through many experiments. All geometry is made by a generative subdivision algorithm, the algorithm's output is a high resolution geometry in the form of a mesh surface.",pictures/digital-grotesque-design-2-l.webp,pictures/zauberfloete-installation-3-l.png,Looks Like Music by Yuri Suzuki,,https://aiartists.org/generative-art-design,"architecture , computor art",

He uses his 3D modeling works as elements on his personal website, adding a lot of interesting interactions to his website. Especially the small scenes he created include many small interactive elements and animations. I also like his use of color, which is usually very harmonious macaron light colors, very clean, and paired with smooth materials, it looks even more dreamy.

left, Rewind ,"Pauline Saglio, interactive designer","This work is made by Pauline Saglio in 2013, she was a student at ECAL (University of Art and Design Lausanne) and she is an interactive designer. This art work is called “Rewind”, it is a collection of digital clocks. The clock itself is designed as a white box Hanging on the wall, there is a black display screen on the surface, and there is a metal switch below the clock. When people turn on the switch, the clock will start to change, and the hands will become dynamic, or the screen will switch. What’s interesting is that this switch will determine which form it shows based on people’s touch or interaction. After the beginning of the electronic age, people use clocks less and less to read time. This work wants to connect with this phenomenon and go back to the past. The author's childhood memories also have a certain influence.",pictures/rewind.jpg,,Rewind 2013,,https://ecal.ch/en/feed/projects/6230/rewind/#-,"personal project , interactive",
